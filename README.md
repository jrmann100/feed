# Feed

A productivity app for students.

## Objectives

Feed is designed to simplify the process of managing **a variety of learning resources**, especially during the distance learning programs implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic.

* It **lists assignments** from a variety of learning platforms. In the future, this will include user-created tasks and personal calendar items. Each item has a direct link to its corresponding information page, if applicable.
* It provides **quick access** to many learning resources via groups of bookmarks for each class.
* It allows for **fast navigation** through a command-line interface.
* It **encourages wellness** through a comprehensive but not overwhelming user interface. Future modules will be designed around simplifying student workflows and productivityâ€”sleep tracking, reminders to sit/stand, timers and alarms, etc.
* It has **extensibility** through clear, documented APIs written in the Svelte language.

*This README is a work in progress; I deleted the first draft on accident, which was much more detailed. -Jordan*
