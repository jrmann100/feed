# Feed

A productivity app for students.

## Objectives

Feed is designed to simplify the process of managing a variety of learning resources.
* It **lists assignments** across various learning platforms. In the future, this will include user-created tasks as well.
* It provides **quick access** to learning resources via groups of bookmarks for each class.
* It allows for **fast navigation** via a command-line interface.
* It **encourages wellness** through a detailed but not overwhelming user interface.
* It has **extensibility** through clear APIs written in Svelte.

*This README is a work in progress; I deleted the first draft on accident, which was much more detailed. -Jordan*
